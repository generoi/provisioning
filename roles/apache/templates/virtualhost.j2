    # Set various options for the SSL engine.
    # o FakeBasicAuth:
    #   Translate the client X.509 into a Basic Authorisation.  This means that
    #   the standard Auth/DBMAuth methods can be used for access control.  The
    #   user name is the `one line' version of the client's X.509 certificate.
    #   Note that no password is obtained from the user. Every entry in the user
    #   file needs this password: `xxj31ZMTZzkVA'.
    # o ExportCertData:
    #   This exports two additional environment variables: SSL_CLIENT_CERT and
    #   SSL_SERVER_CERT. These contain the PEM-encoded certificates of the
    #   server (always existing) and the client (only existing when client
    #   authentication is used). This can be used to import the certificates
    #   into CGI scripts.
    # o StdEnvVars:
    #   This exports the standard SSL/TLS related `SSL_*' environment variables.
    #   Per default this exportation is switched off for performance reasons,
    #   because the extraction step is an expensive operation and is usually
    #   useless for serving static content. So one usually enables the
    #   exportation for CGI and SSI requests only.
    # o StrictRequire:
    #   This denies access when "SSLRequireSSL" or "SSLRequire" applied even
    #   under a "Satisfy any" situation, i.e. when it applies access is denied
    #   and no other module can change it.
    # o OptRenegotiate:
    #   This enables optimized SSL connection renegotiation handling when SSL
    #   directives are used in per-directory context.

    # SSL Protocol Adjustments:
    # The safe and default but still SSL/TLS standard compliant shutdown
    # approach is that mod_ssl sends the close notify alert but doesn't wait for
    # the close notify alert from client. When you need a different shutdown
    # approach you can use one of the following variables:
    # o ssl-unclean-shutdown:
    #   This forces an unclean shutdown when the connection is closed, i.e. no
    #   SSL close notify alert is send or allowed to received.  This violates
    #   the SSL/TLS standard but is needed for some brain-dead browsers. Use
    #   this when you receive I/O errors because of the standard approach where
    #   mod_ssl sends the close notify alert.
    # o ssl-accurate-shutdown:
    #   This forces an accurate shutdown when the connection is closed, i.e. a
    #   SSL close notify alert is send and mod_ssl waits for the close notify
    #   alert of the client. This is 100% SSL/TLS standard compliant, but in
    #   practice often causes hanging connections with brain-dead browsers. Use
    #   this only for browsers where you know that their SSL implementation
    #   works correctly.
    # Notice: Most problems of broken clients are also related to the HTTP
    # keep-alive facility, so you usually additionally want to disable
    # keep-alive for those clients, too. Use variable "nokeepalive" for this.
    # Similarly, one has to force some clients to use HTTP/1.0 to workaround
    # their broken HTTP/1.1 implementation. Use variables "downgrade-1.0" and
    # "force-response-1.0" for this.
    BrowserMatch ".*MSIE.*" \
      nokeepalive ssl-unclean-shutdown \
      downgrade-1.0 force-response-1.0
